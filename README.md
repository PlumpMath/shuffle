# shuffle

A Clojure library designed to ... well, shuffle.

## Usage

```clojure
;use this to find the number of shuffles needed to sort the deck
(shuf-sort cut-size initial-shuffles deck)
;use this to shuffle the deck
(shuf cut-size deck)

;WIP
;cycles, display a list of all of the cycles found while shuffling)
(cycles cut-size deck)
```

The naive implementation is done..
Next up is expermenting/adding a way to get the cycles out of a list
